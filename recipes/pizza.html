        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 packet (2 1/4 teaspoons) active dry yeast</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, dissolve sugar in warm water. Sprinkle yeast over the water and let it sit for about 5 minutes until frothy.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine flour and salt. Make a well in the center and add the yeast mixture and olive oil.</li>
        <li>Mix until a dough forms. Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes until smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li>Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour or until doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 475째F (245째C).</li>
        <li>Once the dough has risen, punch it down and roll it out on a floured surface to your desired thickness.</li>
        <li>Transfer the rolled dough to a pizza stone or baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Spread pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce, then add your choice of toppings.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Garnish with fresh basil leaves before slicing and serving.</li>
    </ol>
