# Odin Recipes

Welcome to **Odin Recipes**!  
A simple project to practice HTML and web development skills as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

---

## 📖 Introduction
In this project, I built a basic recipe website using HTML. I created several recipe pages, added images (sourced from Pexels), and practiced organizing content with lists and headings. The recipes were generated with AI and may not be accurate, as I don't actually know how to cook ^_^

## 📝 What I Learned

- Structuring HTML documents
- Creating and linking multiple pages
- Using lists, images, and links
